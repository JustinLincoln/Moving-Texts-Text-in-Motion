Something with a cat video (from the collection above in LearningProcessing)

Videos sometimes can't play online if the file is too big. Must download

Someone followed "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman to learn to code.

Interesting to browse through, but not good documentation for what is where and many unfamilliar libraries.

THIS!! TIMING w/o frameRate
*** Code showing use of millis(), frameCount, keyPressed interactivity, modulo, booleans... ***
https://amnonp5.wordpress.com/2012/01/28/25-life-saving-tips-for-processing/
(Could be changed with frameRate too, but that woulnd't be useful for making video since it all saves at the same rate anyway.)
* See tip #15 from the site (below)... and tip #1 also gives some other interesting examples (plus noise), but less about timing

boolean blinker;
int timer = -3000;
 
void setup() {
  size(700,400);
  textFont(createFont("Arial",30));
}
 
void draw() {
  background(255);
  fill(0);
  text("you are in frame: " + frameCount,50,50);
  text(millis()/1000 + " seconds have passed since the start", 50,100);
  text("this text will be here forever",50,150);
  if (frameCount < 500) {
    text("this text will be here for 500 frames",50,200);
  }
  if (frameCount > 800) {
    text("this text will be here from 800 frames onwards",50,200);
  }
  if (millis() < 8000) {
    text("this text will be here the first 8 seconds",50,250);
  }
  if (millis() > 12000) {
    text("this text will be here from 12 seconds onwards",50,250);
  }
  if (frameCount % 12 == 0) { blinker = !blinker; }
  if (blinker) {
    text("this text will blink",50,300);
  }
  if (millis() - timer < 3000) {
    text("this text will be here 3 secs after pressing a key",50,350);
  }
}
 
void keyPressed() {
  timer = millis();
}
