Videos sometimes can't play online if the file is too big. Must download

Someone followed "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman to learn to code.

Interesting to browse through, but not good documentation for what is where and many unfamilliar libraries.

THIS!! TIMING w/o frameRate
*** Code showing use of millis(), frameCount, keyPressed interactivity, modulo, booleans... ***
https://amnonp5.wordpress.com/2012/01/28/25-life-saving-tips-for-processing/
(Could be changed with frameRate too, but that woulnd't be useful for making video since it all saves at the same rate anyway.)
* See tip #15 from the site (below)... and tip #1 also gives some other interesting examples (plus noise), but less about timing

boolean blinker;
int timer = -3000;
 
void setup() {
  size(700,400);
  textFont(createFont("Arial",30));
}
 
void draw() {
  background(255);
  fill(0);
  text("you are in frame: " + frameCount,50,50);
  text(millis()/1000 + " seconds have passed since the start", 50,100);
  text("this text will be here forever",50,150);
  if (frameCount < 500) {
    text("this text will be here for 500 frames",50,200);
  }
  if (frameCount > 800) {
    text("this text will be here from 800 frames onwards",50,200);
  }
  if (millis() < 8000) {
    text("this text will be here the first 8 seconds",50,250);
  }
  if (millis() > 12000) {
    text("this text will be here from 12 seconds onwards",50,250);
  }
  if (frameCount % 12 == 0) { blinker = !blinker; }
  if (blinker) {
    text("this text will blink",50,300);
  }
  if (millis() - timer < 3000) {
    text("this text will be here 3 secs after pressing a key",50,350);
  }
}
 
void keyPressed() {
  timer = millis();
}

Another example of timing events using frameCount.
http://cmuems.com/2014c/timed-events/  (Also a generally cool site with programming projects... worth poking around in it.)
"The Modulo operator % calculates the remainder of a division so it can be used to repeat event every -multiples of x-"

void setup()
{
size(300, 300);
frameRate(60);
}
 
void draw()
{
if(frameCount%60 == 0)  // Changes every second since 60 fps
  {
  background(random(255), 255, 255);
  }
 
println(frameRate);
}

-----
As long as the frameRate is constant, it seems like frameCount is easier than trying to use millis().
See https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/how-to-perform-an-action-every-x-seconds-time-delays.html:
 "The unfortunate thing about millis() is that it's not as strict as frameCount (1, 2, 3 etc.) so modulo won't 
  work accurately with millis(). Therefore you have to construct the code so that it does get picked up. 
  A good solution is to use a timer variable and check if >= (equal or more) time has passed..."  
Sounds more complex than necessary.

Q: Reset for looping? How do we avoid hardcoding? Match with a timer that CAN be reset when it starts over?
